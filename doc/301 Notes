US 05.xx
  - borrower's request declined:
    - notify borrower

  - if a request is accepted, all other requests declined automatically

  - book is 'borrowed' only after both lender and borrower scans
    - unless there's a better method for consistency

US 07.xx

    - lender sends geolocation, borrower confirms?
  - default = first book pickup location (B-->L)
    - unless borrower proposes new location (lender must confirm)

Extra notes:
  - no due dates needed
  - if book is gone (lost, stolen, etc.), delete book
  - decide what type of notifications to use (push notification in phone vs in-app or both)
  - assume user only has one copy of each book (for ISBN purposes)
