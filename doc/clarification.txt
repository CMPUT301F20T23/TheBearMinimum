I did not config the username and email at the beginning, so all my commits are using the
default name "Henry He", however in dashboard of CMPUT301F20T23, it can be ensured that
the action is done on behalf of the account with username "Henry417E1610", which is my
GitHub account. I apologize for any of the inconvenience and misunderstanding.
